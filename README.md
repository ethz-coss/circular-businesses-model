## Description

In this agent-based model, I aim to model circular practices in businesses. I specifically focus on the area of non-renewable and finite resources. I use the idea of a material pool to represent the reuse, recycling, repairing, and refurbishing of raw materials within the business. I assume a profit-maximization strategy by the companies and look at how different regulatory policies and consumer preferences impact the choices the effects on the profit of the businesses. I also look at the spatial implications on such a model, when the businesses are located throughout space.

## Features

- Feature 1: "Monopolistic" setup - each company has access to its own set of raw resources and there is no competition in the market.
- Feature 2: "Competitive" setup - each company shares access to one set of raw resources and there is competition in the market.
- Feature 3: "Spatial" influence - here I look at the effect of spatial dynamics in the competitive market. I consider both cases in which everyone in the space shares the same resources as well as when there are different resources in each zone.
